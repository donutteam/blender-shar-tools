# Blender SHAR Tools
A blender addon that adds various tools for working with P3D files from The Simpsons Hit & Run. 

This addon currently targets Blender 4.1.

The Pure3D classes within this repo are based very significantly upon [LuaP3DLib](https://github.com/Hampo/LuaP3DLib) and the [TypeScript Pure3D Library](https://github.com/donutteam/npm-pure3d).
